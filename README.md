# Create an `<a>` Tag with an `href` Attribute

## Learning Goals

- Write an `a` tag to create a link

## Introduction

We've got our HTML tags and we've got our HTML tag attributes. How do we use
them together? We can figure it out by exploring the `a` tag and creating a
link.

## Write an `a` Tag to Create a Link

Open `index.html` in your text editor. Add an `a` tag with the inner text (the
text between the `<a>` tag and the `</a>` tag) of `Flatiron School` anywhere in
the file. Then set the `href` attribute of your new link element to
`https://flatironschool.com`.

You can run the tests with this lab via `learn`. Make sure you save the file
before running the test suite. Failing tests will provide helpful error messages
that you can use to debug your code — read them closely for hints!

### Viewing Your Work in the Browser

While working through these assignments, your general workflow should center on
writing code in the text editor and periodically running the test suite in the
terminal to check your work.

Another great way to track your progress is to open up the HTML document in your
browser and watch how each change you make in the text editor affects the visual
layout in the browser. Do that by running the `httpserver` command in the
browser and then copy the URL from the terminal and then pasting that into your
web browser followed by the path to the file you want to view.

Once you have the HTML document open in your browser, you can make changes to it
in the text editor, save the file, refresh the page in the browser, and see the
changes instantly.

## Conclusion

Here we saw how an attribute helps the `a` tag do its job, which is to link to
another location. Now we can go on to explore some additional HTML tags.
